Branding: Elektor Solar Calculator

The name Elektor was derived from the Greek methodology. Elektor is another name for the god of the sun "Helios" and is often 
translated as "radiant".

The color scheme for the project is Blue (#134373) and Yellow (#FBBC0E). The Blue represents our number one objective which is to build
trust not only for the calculator but also for solar energy, the Yellow represents the sun's radition and optimisim we have for the 
future of mankind.

The Elektor logo was designed using Futura Md BT font. The letter O was replaced with a radiating calculator which shows our core solution.
